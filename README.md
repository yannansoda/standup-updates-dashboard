# Introduction
Doing PhD is a challenging. It becomes even more challenging when you approach the end of it. 
You have to wrap up your research, write many papers and prepare your thesis. 

To make sure I am on track, I set up a daily standup meeting with my colleague and recorded my daily progress in a spreadsheet.
This app is to visualize the data and help me to track my progress. 

Besides tracking my progress, I also regard this project as: 
- a teaser for project management and agile methodologies
- a practice for developing a data science project in a full cycle, from data definition to project deployment
